### Overview

appleseed is an open source, physically-based global illumination rendering engine primarily designed for animation and visual effects.

appleseed is actively developed by a small, international team of talented volunteers from the animation and VFX industry. Its core mission is to provide individuals and small studios with a complete, reliable, fully open rendering package.

Over the years appleseed has been used on several projects including [TV documentaries](https://vimeo.com/81199785), ads, promotional videos and [an animation short](http://www.fetchaveryshortfilm.com/).

appleseed is available under the [MIT license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).
