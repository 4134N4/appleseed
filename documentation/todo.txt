* all projects

    - make sure objects tagged with __declspec(dllexport) present only POD types
      in their interface.

    - implement a mechanism to check that objects are always allocated and deallocated
      using the same memory subsystem.

    - fix non-virtual base class problems in diamond-shaped inheritance patterns.

    - most classes should really inherit (publicly) from foundation::NonCopyable.

    - fix passing of parameters: ParamArray should only be used for the public
      interface of appleseed.renderer. in all other cases, plain function arguments
      should be used.

    - enclose all the code into namespace appleseed?
      update 2009/11/19: done for appleseed.cli and appleseed.studio. 

    - create a new build configuration called 'Safe' with assertions and floating-
      point exceptions enabled.

    - rename APPLESEED_FOUNDATION_USE_SSE to APPLESEED_USE_SSE.

    - unify APPLESEED_FOUNDATION_EXPORTS and APPLESEED_RENDERER_EXPORTS?

    - print better error messages when loading a texture fails
      (PNG images not yet supported by progressive image loader).

    - allow to use PNG textures (only EXR supported in progressive loading mode).



* appleseed.foundation

    - write unit tests for foundation/math/fastmath.h, and measure accuracy and
      performances (also measure performances of arithmetic involving infinite
      and NaN values).

    - make foundation::Dictionary ordered.

    - add functionalities to the unit benchmark component to clear the CPU caches
      before running a benchmark.

    - add attributes (date, time, SVN revision number) to benchmark logs.

    - speed up foundation::radical_inverse() and permuted_radical_inverse() by
      using lookup tables for modulo operations.

    - implement 64-bit radical inverse functions?

    - split foundation::System into multiple classes (CPU, PhysicalMemory).

    - use the _BitScanReverse intrinsic in foundation/math/scalar.h to implement
      log2() and next_pow2().

    - add support for thread exclude lists in foundation::Logger.

    - unit-benchmark the foundation::CDF class.

    - rename renderer::ParamArray to renderer::Parameters.

    - bug: non-copyability is not enforced by foundation::NonCopyable for
      DLL-exported classes.

    - bug: when saving a project to a directory that already contains mesh
      files, if the project references a mesh file that is already present
      on disk, the mesh file doesn't get overwritten, and the old and possibly
      mismatching mesh file is used.



* appleseed.renderer

    - define the renderer::IFilm interface.

    - replace renderer::Frame by an implementation of the renderer::IFilm interface.

    - fix the domain of normalized device coordinates: currently, they are in
      [-0.5,0.5) x (-0.5,0.5], but they really should be in [-0.5,0.5)^2.

    - move foundation/math/samplingcontext.h to renderer/kernel/sampling/.

    - don't initialize Xerces-C each time a project is loaded.

    - make access cache two-staged (direct mapping + LRU).

    - perform SAH binning over all three axis at once.

    - implement parallel building of acceleration structures.

    - find a more elegant way to handle evaluation of uniform inputs.

    - implement writing of texture files in project file writer.

    - during project file parsing: remove blanks around identifiers, and check
      identifier validity.

    - initialize RNG per-tile, based on tile coordinates.

    - in project files, what about changing
        <parameter name="x" value="42" />
      to the cleaner and more generic
        <parameter name="x">42</parameter>
      that would allow to store XML fragments in parameters...

    - add unit tests for edf, bsdf.

    - move Frame::write() and Frame::archive() to separate classes, for instance
      renderer::FrameWriter and renderer::FrameArchiver.

    - add texture transforms (vertical flipping is important).

    - bug: the reported render time is not correct in final rendering mode.



* appleseed.cli



* appleseed.studio

    - add a button "Check All Failed" to the Tests window.

    - initialize override shading menu according to scene settings when loading a scene



* external libraries

    - openexr: remove openexr/vc/vc8/include/, use openexr/include/ instead (and fix
      appleseed.vcproj accordingly).

    - consider moving all external libraries into a new src/externals subdirectory.

    - upgrade Xerces-C library to latest version.
